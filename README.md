<p>Week 1 Kasus : Mengklasifikasikan Spesies Iris</p>
<p>Let’s assume that a hobby botanist is interested in distinguishing the species of some iris flowers that she has found. She has
collected some measurements associated with each iris: the length and width of the petals and the length andwidth of the sepals,
all measured in centimeters. She also has themeasurements of some irises that have been previously identified by an expert
botanist as belonging to the species setosa, versicolor, or virginica. For these measurements, she can be certain of which species
each iris belongs to.
Let’s assume that these are the only species our hobby botanist will encounter in the wild. Our goal is to build a machine learning
model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species is known, so that we can predict the species for a new
iris.</p>
<p>Week 2 Kasus : Dealing with Missing Data</p>
<p>The quality of the data and the amount of useful information that it contains are key factors that
determine how well a machine learning algorithm can learn. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that
we make sure to examine and preprocess a dataset before we feed it to a learning algorithm. It is not uncommon in real world application that our samples are missing one or more values for various reasons. There could have been an error in the data collection process, certain
measurement are not applicable, particular fields could have been simply left blank in survey, for
example. We typically see missing values as the blank spaces in our data table or as placeholder
string such as NaN (not a number). Before we discuss several techniques for dealing with missing
values</p>
