<p>Week 1 Kasus : Mengklasifikasikan Spesies Iris</p>
<p>Let’s assume that a hobby botanist is interested in distinguishing the species of some iris flowers that she has found. She has
collected some measurements associated with each iris: the length and width of the petals and the length andwidth of the sepals,
all measured in centimeters. She also has themeasurements of some irises that have been previously identified by an expert
botanist as belonging to the species setosa, versicolor, or virginica. For these measurements, she can be certain of which species
each iris belongs to.
Let’s assume that these are the only species our hobby botanist will encounter in the wild. Our goal is to build a machine learning
model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species is known, so that we can predict the species for a new
iris.</p>
<p>Week 2 Kasus : Dealing with Missing Data</p>
<p>The quality of the data and the amount of useful information that it contains are key factors that
determine how well a machine learning algorithm can learn. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that
we make sure to examine and preprocess a dataset before we feed it to a learning algorithm. It is not uncommon in real world application that our samples are missing one or more values for various reasons. There could have been an error in the data collection process, certain
measurement are not applicable, particular fields could have been simply left blank in survey, for
example. We typically see missing values as the blank spaces in our data table or as placeholder
string such as NaN (not a number). Before we discuss several techniques for dealing with missing
values</p>
<p>WEEK 03 DATA REPRESENTATION AND FEATURE ENGINEERING </p>
<p>Feature Engineering
In this practice, we will cover a few common examples of features engineering : feature for
representing categorical data, features for representing text and for representing images.
Categorical Features
One common type of non numerical data is categorical data. For example, imagine you are
exploring some data on housing prices, and along with numerical features like “price” and “room”,
you also have “neighborhood” information.</p>
<p>WEEK 04 SUPERVISED LEARNING 1</p>
<strong>LINEAR REGRESSION</strong>
<p>Simple linear regression can be used to model a linear relationship between one response
variable and one explanatory variable. Linear regression has been applied to many important
scientific and social problem.
In this lecture, we will start with a quick intuitive walk-trough of the mathematics behind the wellknown problem, before seeing how before moving on the see how linear models can be generalize
to account for more complicated patterns in data.</p>
